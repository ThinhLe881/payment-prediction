# Perceptron Classifier

Implement a simple Perceptron algorithm from scratch using Python.

## Dataset:

-   Payment information from 30000 online purchase orders
-   Each online purchase order is described by 44 attributes

### Objective:

To assist an online trader in identifying whether a person making an order is likely to pay, using data mining and machine learning techniques.

### Task Overview:

-   Data cleaning by removing irrelevant or noisy information from the dataset.
-   Randomly split the data set into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%).
-   Use a classification algorithm to build a prediction model based on the training data.
-   Evaluate the model's accuracy and generate classification metrics on the test set.

## How to run:

-   Put the dataset in the same directory with the code.

-   Pre-process the dataset:

    ```
    python preprocessing.py
    ```

-   Run Perceptron classification:
    ```
    python perceptron.py
    ```
